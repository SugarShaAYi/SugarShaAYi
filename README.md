## 👋 Hey there, I’m @SugarShaAYi !
### And welcome!

Here's my Github account.

**About name**
- Too long to type?
- You can call me *SugarSha*.
- Or *ss* for short 😆 (Short enough, right?).

**What I do?** 
- I'm a Python 🐍 developer.
- Sometimes I dabble in other programming languages.
- Don't play Python in real life. 🤪

I am passionate about bringing my quirky ideas to life. 🚀

**What's AntYi Inc.?**
- In fact, I don't belong to **any** company.
- The one in my profile was just a **joke**. 🙃
